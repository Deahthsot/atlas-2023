	"description": "Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery and many waterways. The green on Bangladesh's flag represents the aforementioned greenery of the country. The red disc symbolizes the dawn of a new day and end of oppression, as well as the blood of those who died for the independence of the country - it is slightly offset towards the hoist so it appears to be centered when the flag is flying.\n\nThis art depicts the flag of Bangladesh with a Bengal tiger, National Martyrs' Memorial, Martyr Monument.",
